<sebasmagri> anand: you could check out openlayers examples...
<sebasmagri> anand: http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/
<anand> :sebasmagri, there is this mozilla's geolocation API. Are we using it?
<sebasmagri> anand: we will definitely use geolocation to get user's location on app startup...
<anand> sebasmagri: How is this different from the routing API you just mentioned?
<sebasmagri> anand: routing is about getting A to B...
<sebasmagri> anand: geolocation allows apps to get user's location thru the device's GPS or network
<anand> sebasmagri: Ok. So, we need to know the route from A to B first. This is done using the routing API. And then we need to update the position continuously. This is done using geolocation API. Am I correct?
<sebasmagri> anand: the geolocation API would also allow us to have tracking features such as Google's My Tracks or OSMtracker's
<sebasmagri> anand: initially, let's forget about getting the route from A to B... Let's worry about getting device's location and rendering an openstreetmap map to put the position marker on...
<gmridul> sebasmagri: I don't know if this is necessary right now, but how will we test the app. We need to have a mobile device for it, right? and will it work on mobile phones with other platforms?
<sebasmagri> users will still be able to pan and move around... and we would put a search field also...
<sebasmagri> gmridul: the firefox os simulator would allow us to test what we need, and also firefox for android...
<sebasmagri> maybe other desktop and mobile browsers implementing the geolocation WebAPI...
<sebasmagri> as per https://developer.mozilla.org/es/docs/WebAPI/Using_geolocation, almost every modern browser implements geolocation
<anand> sebasmagri: Ok. We need pointers on setting up the firefox os simulator. Then we can start with getting the device's location and rendering.
<sebasmagri> sorry, that's in Spanish... This one is in english https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Using_geolocation
<sebasmagri> anand: gmridul the Firefox OS Simulator is a Firefox Addon... you can install it from https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/firefox-os-simulator/
<sebasmagri> as I can't find anything Firefox OS specific in the GitHub issue, you should be able to work with Firefox also...
<anand> sebasmagri: Ok. And then where should we begin? How does the openplayers examples help us?
<sebasmagri> anand: you should set up a basic map first... following http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/osm.html
<sebasmagri> the openlayers geolocation example will be useful too...
<anand> sebasmagri: Ok. We will start looking at that.
<sebasmagri> http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/geolocation.html
<sebasmagri> try that out and try to understand how that work... after that everything will be easier...
<gmridul> sebasmagri: Thanks a lot for you help
<sebasmagri> you're welcome...
<sebasmagri> I need to go out now...
<anand> sebasmagri: Thanks a lot for starting us out on this. We will keep asking you about this when we are stuck.
<sebasmagri> ping me if you need anything and I will check this out later...
<anand> sebasmagri: Should we always contact you here?
<anand> sebasmagri:What are the preferable timings?
<sebasmagri> anand: gmridul you can find me @gmail.com also...
<sebasmagri> I'm -4.30 UTC
<sebasmagri> if I don't answer quickly, send me an email... :)
<anand> sebasmagri: Ok. Thanks a lot!
<sebasmagri> I'm heading out now.. see ya later!
